# This is Inumuta, a basic IRC bot that offers Sovereign-like functions that can be added / removed at will.

# and b) more understandable by me when I have to go back and look at this six months from now and try to figure out
#     what the hell I was thinking at the time.
# Of course, Python doesn't do multi-line comments, so this will be extra fun.
